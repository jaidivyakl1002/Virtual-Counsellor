### Data Processing and Ingestion Pipeline

#### Phase 1: Data Collection and Validation

```python
class DataIngestionPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scrapers = {
            'careers': CareerDataScraper(),
            'colleges': CollegeDataScraper(),
            'courses': CourseDataScraper(),
            'scholarships': ScholarshipScraper(),
            'market_trends': TrendAnalyzer()
        }
        self.validators = DataValidationSuite()
        self.quality_checker = QualityAssessmentTool()
    
    async def collect_data(self, source_type: str):
        """Collect data from specified sources with rate limiting and error handling"""
        raw_data = await self.scrapers[source_type].fetch_data()
        validated_data = self.validators.validate(raw_data)
        quality_score = self.quality_checker.assess(validated_data)
        return self._prepare_for_embedding(validated_data, quality_score)
```

#### Phase 2: Document Processing and Chunking

**Chunking Strategy**:
- **Career Profiles**: Semantic chunking by sections (responsibilities, requirements, trends)
- **College Information**: Hierarchical chunking (institution → program → specialization)
- **Course Content**: Topic-based chunking aligned with learning modules
- **Market Data**: Temporal chunking for trend analysis

**Text Processing Pipeline**:
```python
def process_documents(documents):
    processed_docs = []
    for doc in documents:
        # 1. Clean and normalize text
        cleaned_text = clean_text(doc.content)
        
        # 2. Extract structured information
        structured_data = extract_entities(cleaned_text)
        
        # 3. Create semantic chunks
        chunks = semantic_chunker.split(
            text=cleaned_text,
            chunk_size=1000,
            chunk_overlap=200,
            separators=["\n\n", "\n", ".", "!"]
        )
        
        # 4. Add metadata
        for chunk in chunks:
            chunk.metadata.update({
                'source': doc.source,
                'processing_date': datetime.now(),
                'quality_score': doc.quality_score,
                'semantic_category': classify_content(chunk.content)
            })
            
        processed_docs.extend(chunks)
    
    return processed_docs
```

#### Phase 3: Embedding Generation and Storage

**Embedding Strategy**:
```python
class EmbeddingManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embedding_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-ada-002")
        self.vector_store = ChromaDB(persist_directory="./career_counselor_db")
    
    async def generate_embeddings(self, documents):
        """Generate embeddings with batch processing and caching"""
        embeddings = []
        for batch in self._batch_documents(documents, batch_size=100):
            batch_embeddings = await self.embedding_model.aembed_documents(
                [doc.page_content for doc in batch]
            )
            embeddings.extend(batch_embeddings)
        
        return embeddings
    
    def store_documents(self, documents, embeddings):
        """Store documents and embeddings with proper indexing"""
        self.vector_store.add_documents(
            documents=documents,
            embeddings=embeddings,
            metadatas=[doc.metadata for doc in documents]
        )
```

### Retrieval Strategy and Optimization

#### Multi-Stage Retrieval Process

```python
class CareerCounselorRetriever:
    def __init__(self, vector_store):
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        self.reranker = CrossEncoderReranker()
        self.query_expander = QueryExpansionTool()
    
    async def retrieve_context(self, query: str, user_profile: dict, k: int = 10):
        # Stage 1: Query expansion and enhancement
        expanded_queries = self.query_expander.expand(query, user_profile)
        
        # Stage 2: Multi-query retrieval
        all_results = []
        for exp_query in expanded_queries:
            results = await self.vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(
                query=exp_query,
                k=k,
                filter=self._build_metadata_filter(user_profile)
            )
            all_results.extend(results)
        
        # Stage 3: Deduplication and reranking
        unique_results = self._deduplicate(all_results)
        reranked_results = self.reranker.rerank(query, unique_results)
        
        # Stage 4: Context assembly
        return self._assemble_context(reranked_results[:k])
    
    def _build_metadata_filter(self, user_profile):
        """Build metadata filters based on user context"""
        filters = {}
        if user_profile.get('location'):
            filters['region'] = user_profile['location']
        if user_profile.get('academic_level'):
            filters['target_audience'] = user_profile['academic_level']
        return filters
```

#### Query Enhancement Strategies

**1. Semantic Query Expansion**:
```python
def expand_career_query(original_query, user_context):
    """Expand queries with career-specific synonyms and context"""
    expansions = []
    
    # Add domain synonyms
    if "software" in original_query:
        expansions.extend(["programming", "development", "coding", "IT"])
    
    # Add level-specific context
    if user_context.get('academic_year') == 'high_school':
        expansions.extend(["undergraduate programs", "entrance exams", "career exploration"])
    
    # Add location context
    if user_context.get('location'):
        expansions.extend([f"opportunities in {user_context['location']}", "local job market"])
    
    return expansions
```

**2. Contextual Filtering**:
```python
def apply_contextual_filters(search_results, user_profile):
    """Filter and prioritize results based on user context"""
    filtered_results = []
    
    for result in search_results:
        relevance_score = calculate_relevance(result, user_profile)
        if relevance_score > 0.6:  # Threshold for relevance
            result.metadata['contextual_relevance'] = relevance_score
            filtered_results.append(result)
    
    return sorted(filtered_results, key=lambda x: x.metadata['contextual_relevance'], reverse=True)
```

### Data Quality and Maintenance

#### Quality Assurance Framework

**1. Automated Quality Checks**:
```python
class DataQualityAssessor:
    def assess_document_quality(self, document):
        quality_score = 0
        
        # Completeness check (40% weight)
        completeness = self._check_completeness(document)
        quality_score += completeness * 0.4
        
        # Accuracy check (30% weight)
        accuracy = self._verify_accuracy(document)
        quality_score += accuracy * 0.3
        
        # Freshness check (20% weight)
        freshness = self._check_freshness(document)
        quality_score += freshness * 0.2
        
        # Source reliability (10% weight)
        reliability = self._assess_source_reliability(document.source)
        quality_score += reliability * 0.1
        
        return quality_score
```

**2. Continuous Monitoring**:
- **Weekly**: Automated checks for broken links and outdated information
- **Monthly**: Salary data updates and market trend refreshes
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive review of college information and course catalogs
- **Annually**: Complete database refresh and quality audit

#### Data Update Pipeline

```python
class DataMaintenancePipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.update_scheduler = CronScheduler()
        self.change_detector = ChangeDetectionService()
        self.validation_service = DataValidationService()
    
    async def schedule_updates(self):
        """Schedule different types of updates based on data volatility"""
        
        # High-frequency updates (daily)
        self.update_scheduler.add_job(
            func=self.update_job_market_data,
            trigger='cron',
            hour=2,  # 2 AM daily
            id='daily_job_market_update'
        )
        
        # Medium-frequency updates (weekly)
        self.update_scheduler.add_job(
            func=self.update_course_information,
            trigger='cron',
            day_of_week='sunday',
            hour=3,  # 3 AM every Sunday
            id='weekly_course_update'
        )
        
        # Low-frequency updates (monthly)
        self.update_scheduler.add_job(
            func=self.update_college_information,
            trigger='cron',
            day=1,  # 1st of every month
            hour=4,  # 4 AM
            id='monthly_college_update'
        )
```
